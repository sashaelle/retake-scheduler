Description: 
A URL-based, capacity-aware scheduling system for academic exam retakes. Admins create capacity-limited time slots and share a unique link for students to book without overbooking. 

Planned Features (MVP): 
- Create retake session
- Create time slots with capacity
- Book a slot (capacity decreases; prevents overbooking)
